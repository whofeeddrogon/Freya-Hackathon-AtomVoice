## 🚀 Project Overview
**Atom Voice AI** is a modular, scenario-agnostic voice chat framework designed for high-performance, real-time human-machine interaction. Developed for the **Freya x fal.ai Voice AI Hackathon**, our team secured **2nd Place** by delivering a seamless, low-latency conversational experience.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture (STT → LLM → TTS)
Atom distinguishes itself by utilizing an end-to-end **Streaming Pipeline** to eliminate traditional "turn-based" delays:

* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** High-speed audio transcription powered by **Freya Voice AI**.
* **Large Language Model (LLM):** Context-aware intelligence layer for generating real-time responses.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Lifelike neural synthesis powered by **Freya Voice AI**.
* **Ultra-Low Latency:** By implementing data streaming across the entire pipeline, Atom begins synthesizing responses while the LLM is still generating tokens, ensuring a natural, fluid conversation.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The STT and TTS endpoints used during the hackathon were specifically provided for the event and are currently inactive. To run the application, you must configure your own valid API endpoints.
